# Autopsy
Forensic Recovery Procedure
In today’s digital world, most fraud can be tracked electronically. In this repository I will use Basis Technology’s Autopsy application to analyze a storage device for evidence related to a possible violation of company policy. Within Autopsy I analyzed the storage device for data files, deleted data files, directories, or drive partitions. I have provided screenshots of my steps for you to follow along as I gathered evidence to  write a final report to present the findings to senior management.
